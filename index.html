        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>With the advance of technologies and digitalization, we can store and reproduce multimedia contents nowadays. We can even manipulate the materials in a way that we couldn't imagine before the digitalization. For example, image resizing and video editing, which changes the dimensionailty of the digital pictures spatially and temperally, repectively. Another ubiquitous application regarding audio signals called time-scaled modification (TSM) is used in our daily life. It's also known as playback speed contorl in the video streaming platform such as YouTube.</p>
        <p>With the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and modern computation hardwares, however, we didn't see any application that improves the quality of the synthetic audio from TSM, considering we have pragmatic AI tools in similar domains like image super resolution for example.</p>
